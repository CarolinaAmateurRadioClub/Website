You must have an FRN number to be tested. If you don't have one, go to this site: [FCC FRN Registration Link](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/getting-fcc-registration-number-frn), click Register, and follow directions to set up your account. Testing will not be done unless the above is brought with the testee. We are no longer allowed to ask for or use SSNs for testing. You can do this on your smart phone at the testing location if you choose to do so.

Along with the above, please bring a Government ID, a copy of your license, if you have one, and your FRN and have all the correct answers. There is no fee to test, unless we are doing an ARRL session, then the cost will be $15. Please RSVP to the email below with your name, phone, and date you wish to test on. If you know which class you wish to test for please include that also.
