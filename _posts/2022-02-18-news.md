The Club that puts Fun in Ham Radio

One of the great things about Ham Radio is it's ability to bring people together.  Whether getting together at a hamfest, attending a seminar, making a QSO with a station around the world or getting together with friends on a project. Ham Radio is at it's best when we can share the excitement of this hobby.

Nowhere is this more true than at Amateur Radio Club meetings that occur everyday across the U.S. and around the world. Both new and experienced operators gather to organize Ham Radio events, discuss technical issues, listen to presentations, volunteer in the community, perform licensing exams, swap stories and gear and generally promote the importance of Ham Radio to anyone who is willing to listen.

If you are a newly licensed ham or are thinking about becoming one...rest assured that you won't find a more welcoming club than the Caroilna Amateur Radio Club.
