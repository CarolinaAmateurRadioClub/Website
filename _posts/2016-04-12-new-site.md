title: Carolina Radio Club New Site
---

I hope this will satisfy the needs of the club as it did take awhile for me to get the time to work on a site and get it onto something maintainable for anyone who wishes to help update it. If anyone has any issues with the new design let me know as I am still improving on it as we go. This is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github](http://github.com) for hosting.

### Jekyll 

Key reasons for using this are:

* Everything is a simple text file and can be edited in notepad. Does not require a editor or bulky software to edit.
* Automatically formats everything appropriately as long as you use markdown and for reference: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Distributed maintenance via Github, no one has to be the owner of the server or content, everyone involved is.
* Audit trail of who made changes last to the site and usually why, or at least a comment.

Thank you everyone for your patience,
